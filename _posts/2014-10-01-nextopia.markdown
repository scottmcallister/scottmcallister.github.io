description: As a software developer for Nextopia, Scott worked on various features of Nextopia's product suite. These features included building a reporting section for autocomplete data, creating a geo-merchandizing section, implementing a templating system for Nextopia's "product finder" product, and many others. The server side code for Nextopia was written in PHP while the front end interface used jQuery for DOM manipulation.

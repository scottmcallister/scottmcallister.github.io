As far as NoSql databases go, MongoDB is one of the most popular and recognizable
options out there. It's been widely adopted in the Node JS community as the data
store for the popular MEAN stack.

##Installation

MongoDB can be installed on Mac, Windows, and Linux systems and there are slight
differences between installation methods on each platform. I'm going to be
installing on Mac, so if you're using Windows or Linux I'd recommend taking a
look at MongoDB's [documentation][mongo-install].

In general the only steps involved are creating a directory to store the database
and installing the executables needed to run a Mongo server. The default directory
for storing a Mongo database is `/data/db`, so make sure this directory exists
and the user you're logged in as has write permissions.

<pre>
<code>$ sudo mkdir /data/db
$ sudo chown -R yourusername:wheel /data/db</code>
</pre>

For installing the MongoDB executables, we'll be using Homebrew.

<pre>
<code>$ brew update
$ brew install mongodb</code>
</pre>

If you'd rather install MongoDB without Homebrew, there are [instructions][mongo-manual] on MongoDB's
website showing you how to install manually.

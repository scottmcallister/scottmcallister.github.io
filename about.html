<h2>My Name Is Scott</h2>

<p>I have years of professional experience writing code accross the entire stack

using a wide variety of different tools. I've been working quite a bit with Java and React 
lately, but I try to learn as much as I can about different tools and frameworks.</p>

<p>I'm currently living in Fredericton, New Brunswick with my lovely wife Kelly, our cat
Theodore, and our dog Linus. When I'm not writing code I like playing guitar, 
watching Netflix, and playing/watching basketball. </p>

<h2>My Name Is Scott</h2>

<p>I have years of professional experience writing code accross the entire stack
using a wide variety of different tools. Modern Javascript development is my
area of expertise, but I try to learn as much as I can about different tools and
frameworks.</p>

<p>I've been living in Toronto since 2014 with my lovely wife Kelly, our cat
Theodore, and our dog Linus. When I'm not writing code I like playing guitar, 
watching Netflix, and playing/watching basketball. </p>

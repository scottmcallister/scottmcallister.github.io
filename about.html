<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I have years of experience working with both client side and server side code
in a wide variety of different tech stacks. My specialty is Node
JS and modern Javascript development, but I try to learn as much as
I can about different programming languages, tools, and frameworks.</p>

<p>I've been living in Toronto since 2014 with my lovely wife Kelly and our cat
Theodore. When I'm not writing code I like playing guitar, watching Netflix and
playing/watching basketball. </p>

<h2>My Name Is Scott</h2>

<p>I have years of professional experience writing code accross the entire stack
using a wide variety of different tools. My specialty is Node JS and modern
Javascript development, but I try to learn as much as I can about different
programming languages, tools, and frameworks.</p>

<p>I've been living in Toronto since 2014 with my lovely wife Kelly and our cat
Theodore. When I'm not writing code I like playing guitar, watching Netflix and
playing/watching basketball. </p>
